### 5. **Creator Insights (by)**
- **Count:** Data for 2390 creators, hinting at potential under-reporting. The top contributor is Kiefer Sutherland, with 48 occurrences.
- **Missing Values:** A notable number of missing entries (262) indicates a lack of attribution for many works, which could hinder analysis on creator impact or region.

### 6. **Numerical Ratings**
- **Overall Rating:**
  - **Mean:** 3.05, indicating a generally middle-of-the-road reception.
  - **Standard Deviation:** 0.76 suggests a moderate variation among ratings.
  - **Range:** Ratings span from 1 to 5, with a clear lower quartile residing at 3.
  
- **Quality Rating:**
  - **Mean:** 3.21 signifies slightly higher quality perception compared to overall ratings.
  - **Distribution:** Similar to overall ratings, with evidence suggesting most content centers around average ratings.

- **Repeatability Rating:**
  - **Mean:** 1.49 with a max of 3 suggests that most respondents don’t frequently revisit content.
  - **Median (1)** implies a common tendency to engage with new content rather than revisit old.

### 7. **Correlation Analysis**

- **Quality and Overall Ratings (0.83):** Relatively high correlation suggests that higher quality often aligns with better overall ratings.
- **Quality and Repeatability (0.31):** Indicates some relationship; however, the low correlation suggests other factors influence repeatability aside from quality.

### 8. **Missing Values Overview**
- Overall, the dataset shows robust entries, but certain categories like date and creator have missing values. Addressing these gaps could refine the dataset and yield deeper insights into the content's contextual background.

### **Conclusion and Recommendations:**
The analysis reveals a dataset dominated by English language movies, emphasizing notable titles and creators while also showcasing strong overall engagement ratings. It would be advantageous to:
- Explore additional factors influencing the high frequency of specific dates and titles.
- Investigate underrepresented categories or creators to enhance diversity.
- Conduct further research into the reasons behind the correlation metrics to identify key drivers of audience engagement and repeat behavior.

Additionally, addressing the missing values could significantly enrich the dataset's usability and relevance for future inquiries or projects.
